Simple game I am working on to mess around with "juciness" and "tweening"

to play:
* run main.py

* press space to jump
* jump from platform to platform

* if you fall off press R to restart

if you have any ideas send them to nickjarvis47@yahoo.com and I will gladly listen to
and possibly add them.
